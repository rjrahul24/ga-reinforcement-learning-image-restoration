# Genetic Algorithm and Reinforcement Learning

A Project using Genetic Algorithms and Reinforcement Learning mechanisms to implement Image Restoration and Recreation.

# Genetic Algorithms
Genetic algorithms are random, adaptive heuristic search algorithms that act on a population of doable solutions. they need loosely supported the mechanics of population biology and choice.Â 
Genetic algorithms are based on the ideas of natural selection and genetics. New solutions are typically made by 'mutating' members of this population, and by 'mating' 2 resolutions along to create a replacement solution.
